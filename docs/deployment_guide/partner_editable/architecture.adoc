.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} for Amazon EKS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[The figure is an architectural diagram of the Partner Solution for {partner-product-name}]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans either two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured across two Availability Zones. In each Availability Zone, this Partner Solution provisions one public subnet and one private subnet. This creates a logically isolated networking environment that you can connect to your on-premises data centers or use as a standalone environment.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** One public subnet has a boot node, an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, to access the Amazon EKS cluster.
* In the private subnets:
** An EKS cluster with an application pod, WebSphere Liberty Operator, certificate manager, and https://olm.operatorframework.io/[Operator Lifecycle Manager].
** Amazon EKS managed node groups to automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and track metrics for your AWS resources and applications.
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to store, share, and deploy container software such as application images and artifacts.
* Classic Load Balancer to enable HTTPS access to an application.

//[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
