As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** One boot node, an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, to access the Amazon EKS cluster.
* In the private subnets, an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html[Amazon EKS managed node group^] to automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of the nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) for the EKS cluster. Each node comprises the following:
** An {partner-product-short-name} operator, a Kubernetes extension that helps you deploy and manage WebSphere Liberty applications.
** One or more optional application pods for an {partner-product-short-name} application, which is deployed as a custom resource.
** An X.509 certificate manager, which issues certificates for secure access to the WebSphere Liberty application.
** https://olm.operatorframework.io/[Operator Lifecycle Manager^], which manages the WebSphere Liberty operator and keeps it up to date.
* A Classic Load Balancer to enable HTTPS access to the application.
* Amazon EKS, which provides the Kubernetes control plane for the cluster.
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to store, share, and deploy container software, such as application images and artifacts.
* Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and track metrics for your AWS resources and applications.
