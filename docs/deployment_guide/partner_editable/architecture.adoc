.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} for Amazon EKS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured across two Availability Zones. In each Availability Zone, this Quick Start provisions one public subnet and one private subnet. This creates a logically isolated networking environment that you can connect to your on-premises data centers or use as a standalone environment.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** One Availability Zone has a boot node, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), to access the Amazon EKS cluster.
* In the private subnets:
** An EKS cluster with an application pod, WebSphere Liberty Operator, certificate manager, and operator lifecycle manager.
** Auto Scaling enabled for the EKS cluster to automatically add or remove servers based on their use, providing additional servers during peak hours and lowering costs by removing servers during off hours. The default installation sets up CPU-based thresholds for scaling the instance capacity up or down. You can modify these thresholds after deployment.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and track metrics for your AWS resources and applications.
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to store, share, and deploy container software such as application images and artifacts.
* Grouping of the private subnets with an Auto Scaling Group for inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access and Amazon EKS for the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure and platform.
* Ingress controllers, which provide HTTPS load balancing across the WebSphere Liberty instances. This Quick Start uses an Application Load Balancer, which is configured to use HTTPS.
* Appropriate security groups for each instance or function to restrict access to only necessary protocols and ports. For example, access to HTTPS server ports on Amazon EC2 web servers is limited to the Application Load Balancer.
