This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/qYyer?[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster with a sample application^]. This option builds a new AWS environment, as outlined in the architecture diagram. It then installs a {partner-product-short-name} operator and related artifacts into the EKS cluster. It also deploys a sample or custom application and enables HTTPS access to the application.

* https://fwd.aws/dvmWv?[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster with no application^]. This option builds a new AWS environment, as outlined in the architecture diagram. It then installs a {partner-product-short-name} operator and related artifacts into the EKS cluster.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
