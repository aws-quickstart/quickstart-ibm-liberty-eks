This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster with a sample application^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, boot node, and other infrastructure components. It then creates a new EKS into this new VPC and deploys an {partner-product-short-name} operator, an application, and related artifacts into this EKS cluster.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster with no application^]. This option builds the same AWS environment but without the sample application.

This Partner Solution uses the same template for both options. The first option has the `<___>` parameter preset to *<___>*. For both options, you can configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and <___> settings.

//TODO Vinod, Please edit the final paragraph for accuracy. This paragraph is just a placeholder based on a recent EKS doc.
