It then creates a new EKS into this new VPC and deploys {partner-product-short-name} Operator, an application, and related artifacts into this EKS cluster.
// * http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC^]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster without an application^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, boot node, and other infrastructure components.
