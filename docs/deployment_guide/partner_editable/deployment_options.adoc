This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster with a sample application^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, boot node, and other infrastructure components. It then creates a new EKS into this new VPC and deploys an {partner-product-short-name} operator, an application, and related artifacts into this EKS cluster.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster with no application^]. This option builds the same AWS environment but without the sample application.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
