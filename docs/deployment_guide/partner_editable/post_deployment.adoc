== Postdeployment steps

. Deploy License Service on your EKS cluster. 
+
License Service is required to measure and track license use of IBM containerized software, such as the {partner-product-short-name} application. Manual license measurements are not allowed. 
+
For more information, refer to https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSHKN6/license-service/1.x.x/standalone-LS.html[Tracking license usage of stand-alone IBM Containerized Software^].

. If you deployed an application, either the sample that came with this Partner Solution or a custom application, launch it to confirm that it works. 
.. Go to the main stack.
.. Choose the *Outputs* tab.
.. Choose the value of the `AppEndpoint` key.

. (Optional) Manually deploy a custom application using a `WebSphereLibertyApplication` custom resource (CR) file that sets parameter values for your application image.
