== Predeployment steps

. Confirm that you have a license that entitles you to use IBM {partner-product-short-name}.

For more information, refer to <<#_costs_and_licenses>> earlier in this guide.

. Download and configure the Kubernetes command line interface so that you can manage deployed applications and resources with `kubectl` commands.
+
For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html[Installing or updating kubectl^].

. (Optional) Note the ARNs that need to access the EKS cluster.
+
By default, you can access the EKS cluster from boot node only. If you want to enable direct access to the EKS cluster, prepare a list of Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that need to have this access. When you deploy this solution, you'll enter those ARNS in a comma-delimited list in the parameter `AdditionalEKSAdminArns`.
